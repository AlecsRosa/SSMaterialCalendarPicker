##**SSMaterialCalendarPicker**##
****************************
A lightly-customizable calendar pop-up view for range selection inspired by Google's Material Design Guidelines and apps.

Tested on iOS8 and iOS9. Supports **ONLY** portrait orientation, atm.


##Installation##
****************
I'm preparing this component to be listed as a pod for CocoaPods.  
Installation should be as follows, adding this line to your Podfile:

```
#!ruby

pod 'SSMaterialCalendarPicker'
```
